					This is where you would introduce yourself. You might include links to things <a href="//google.com">RANDOM LINK TO GOOGLE</a>. You might have links to outside websites or things like your resume.
					
					You might also talk about groups that you have worked with (and perhaps link to them), and/or put your interests here!

			                <p> I hold a Master's degree in Biostatistics from the University of Washington and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Cognitive Science from Rutgers University - New Brunswick. During my time at the University of Washington, I worked as a Research Assistant, where I played a key role in standardizing stepped wedge datasets to ensure they were prepared for analysis. <a href="https://www.cff.org/researchers/therapeutics-development-network"> Therapeutics Development Network </a> supporting the design of randomized interventional trials for cystic fibrosis. </p>
					
					<p> I am broadly interested in Biostatistics and Data Science, and enjoy the process of engaging domain science, statistical models and programmatic data analysis. </p>

		<strong>A Retrospective Cohort Study of Combined Pharmacist and Primary Care Interventions for Type 2 Diabetes Management</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Collaborated with Valley View Health Center and my cohort to investigate the effectiveness of pharmacist-led interventions combined with primary care versus primary care-only intervention in managing Type 2 Diabetes at Valley View Health Center. </li>
		<li> Performed data cleaning and conducted longitudinal analysis using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models and survival analysis with Cox proportional hazards models.</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Investigation of Alternative Scoliosis Diagnosis Method as a Substitute for Cobb Angle</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Developed predictive models using Lasso and Ridge regression to estimate Cobb angles and classify scoliosis severity. </li>
		<li> Conducted permutation tests to validate the statistical significance of the relationship between angle of trunk inclination (ATI) and Cobb angle.</li>
		</ul>
